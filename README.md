Creating and managing website and port probes
=====
1. The CopperEgg Cookbook contains a LightWeight Resource Provider (LWRP) for simplifying the automation of CopperEgg probes.  
2. To create a copperegg probe, you need to include something similar to the following example:  

```ruby
  copperegg_probe "ChefProbe2" do
    provider "copperegg_probe"
    action :update                        # update will create or update
    probe_desc 'ChefProbe2'               # the 'name' of the probe
    probe_dest "http://yoursite.com"      # the URL to test
    type 'GET'                            # the test type; in this case, an HTTP GET request
    stations ['dal','nrk']                # override the defaults and specify testing from Dallas and Fremont
  end 
```  

3. You can find descriptions of all required and optional fields in copperegg/resources/probe.rb.
4. Refer to the Probe section of the CopperEgg API for further details:  [CopperEgg Probe API](http://dev.copperegg.com/revealuptime/probes.html)


Creating Annotations in the CopperEgg UI for chef run events.
=====
1. The CopperEgg Cookbook includes integration with the Chef Report and Exception Handlers. To enable this functionality:
* include the chef_handler cookbook from Opscode in your chef repo, and in your run list.
* include the recipe copperegg-handler.rb in your run list. That's it!
* By default, each chef run will create a annotation at copperegg only when the chef run fails. 
* You can change this behavior by changing the [:copperegg][:annotate_chefrun_success] and [:copperegg][:annotate_chefrun_fail] attributes.
