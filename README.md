Creating and managing website and port probes
=====
1. The Uptime Cloud Monitor Cookbook contains a LightWeight Resource Provider (LWRP) for simplifying the automation of Uptime Cloud Monitor probes.
2. To create a copperegg probe, you need to include something similar to the following example:

```ruby
  copperegg_probe "ChefProbe2" do
    provider "copperegg_probe"
    action :update                        # update will create or update
    probe_desc 'ChefProbe2'               # the 'name' of the probe
    probe_dest "http://yoursite.com"      # the URL to test
    type 'GET'                            # the test type; in this case, an HTTP GET request
    stations ['dal','nrk']                # override the defaults and specify testing from Dallas and Fremont
    tags ["production",'load_balancer']   # The tags to apply to this probe
  end
```

3. You can find descriptions of all required and optional fields in copperegg/resources/probe.rb.
4. Refer to the Probe section of the Uptime Cloud Monitor API for further details:  [Uptime Cloud Monitor Probe API](http://dev.copperegg.com/revealuptime/probes.html)


Creating Annotations in the Uptime Cloud Monitor UI for chef run events.
=====
The Uptime Cloud Monitor Cookbook includes integration with the Chef Report and Exception
Handlers. To enable this functionality choose one of the following:
* Include the recipe copperegg-handler.rb in your run_list, or
* Include the recipe copperegg-handler in your application cookbook with
`include_recipe`.

That's it!

Note:
* By default, each chef run will create an annotation at copperegg only when the chef run fails.
* You can change this behavior by changing the [:copperegg][:annotate_chefrun_success] and [:copperegg][:annotate_chefrun_fail] attributes in the default attributes file or by overriding them in your application cookbook.
